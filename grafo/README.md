repository for the implementation and complexity evaluation as assigned by this activity.

impl: precompiled python code that can be run via
      `$ ./executar.sh input output`
      input files can be found inside the folder.
      you can check the result with the expected outputs in impl/out folder

tests: perfomance and complexity evaluation of the algorithm.
       you can run by
       `$ ./run_sparse input`
       or
       `$ ./run_dense input`
